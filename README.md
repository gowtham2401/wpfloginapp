**## Introduction**

This project is a simple **WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) Login Application** developed using **C# and .NET**.  
It demonstrates how to create a desktop application with a login interface using **XAML** for UI design and **C# code-behind** for handling logic and events.

The main goal of this project is to understand the fundamentals of WPF, including window navigation, user input handling, and basic authentication logic. This project is suitable for beginners who are learning **.NET desktop application development** and want hands-on experience with WPF.

The application can be further extended by integrating a database, implementing the MVVM pattern, or improving the UI design.
